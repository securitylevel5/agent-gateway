# agent_gateway

An mTLS HTTP/2 CONNECT proxy that authorizes connections based on custom X.509 certificate extensions.

The proxy accepts incoming mTLS connections, extracts a custom extension value from the client certificate, and checks a PostgreSQL-backed signed permission registry to decide whether the client may connect to the requested destination. If allowed, it opens a raw TCP connection to the destination and tunnels data bidirectionally. The client is responsible for establishing its own TLS session to the destination through the tunnel.

## Building

```
cargo build --release
```

The end-to-end demo, sidecar, TPM setup, mock services, and registry helper
scripts live in the [split demo repository](https://github.com/sl5taskforce/agent-gateway-demo). The demo pins a gateway image such as
`ghcr.io/sl5taskforce/agent-gateway:main` and does not require this source checkout.

## Configuration

Copy `config.example.toml` to `config.toml` and edit it. Key sections:

**`[server]`** -- Listen address and TLS material.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `listen_addr` | yes | `host:port` to bind (e.g. `0.0.0.0:8443`) |
| `tls_cert_path` | yes | PEM server certificate |
| `tls_key_path` | yes | PEM private key for the server cert |

**`[policy]`** -- Configures the certificate identity extension and Postgres registry access.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `client_ext_oid` | OID of the custom X.509 extension to extract (dotted notation) |
| `database_url` | Postgres URL for the authorization registry. Prefer `database_url_env` outside local development. |
| `database_url_env` | Environment variable containing the Postgres URL. |
| `max_connections` | Maximum Postgres pool connections. Defaults to `5`. |
| `connect_timeout_ms` | Postgres connection timeout. Defaults to `5000`. |
| `pool_acquire_timeout_ms` | Pool acquire timeout per authorization check. Defaults to `1000`. |
| `query_timeout_ms` | Query timeout per registry lookup. Defaults to `500`. |

**`[observability]`** -- Logging and tracing.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `log_level` | yes | `tracing` filter (e.g. `info`, `debug`, `agent_gateway=debug`) |
| `otlp_endpoint` | no | OTLP gRPC endpoint for distributed tracing |

Set `AGENT_GATEWAY_LOG_STDOUT=false` to disable stdout/stderr formatting while
leaving OTLP export enabled.

## Running

```
agent_gateway --config config.toml
```

Run migrations explicitly before starting the gateway:

```bash
psql "$AGENT_GATEWAY_DATABASE_URL" -f migrations/0001_signed_authorization_registry.sql
```

Gateway startup verifies the authorization registry schema version and fails fast if the database is not migrated. The runtime gateway database role should be read-only for authorization tables; use a separate admin role for migrations and registry writes.

Shut down cleanly with `Ctrl-C`.

## Authorization Registry

The gateway authorizes a CONNECT only when all of these checks pass:

1. The mTLS client certificate has the configured UTF8String identity extension.
2. The requested authority normalizes to a `host:port` destination.
3. Postgres contains an active `permission_registry` row for that identity, destination, and the leaf certificate's exact SubjectPublicKeyInfo DER.
4. The row's `signature` verifies over the canonical permission row fields with the referenced active principal signing key.
5. `principal_key_permissions` confirms that the signing key was allowed to delegate that destination.

### Database Structure

The authorization registry has three main tables:

| Table | Key Columns | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `principal_signing_keys` | `key_id`, `algorithm`, `public_key_spki_der`, `not_before`, `not_after`, `revoked_at` | Stores trusted P-256 public keys that may sign permissions. |
| `principal_key_permissions` | `signing_key_id`, `destination`, `not_before`, `not_after`, `revoked_at` | Defines which destinations each signing key is allowed to delegate. |
| `permission_registry` | `permission_id`, `signing_key_id`, `subject_identity`, `subject_public_key_spki_der`, `destination`, `not_before`, `not_after`, `revoked_at`, `signature` | Stores signed permissions that authorize a subject identity and exact subject key to reach a normalized destination. |

`principal_key_permissions.signing_key_id` and `permission_registry.signing_key_id` both reference `principal_signing_keys.key_id`. A permission is usable only when the permission row is active, the signing key is active, the signature verifies over the canonical row fields, and the signing key has a matching destination delegation row.

The signed bytes are the following UTF-8 text, with fields in this exact order and timestamps formatted as UTC RFC 3339 with six fractional digits:

```text
agent-gateway-permission-v2
permission_id=perm-1
signing_key_id=org-alice
subject_identity=agent-alpha
subject_public_key_spki_der=3059301306072a8648ce3d020106082a8648ce3d03010703420004...
destination=api.example.com:443
not_before=2026-05-01T00:00:00.000000Z
not_after=2026-06-01T00:00:00.000000Z
capacity_bytes=10485760
refill_bytes_per_sec=1048576
```

Destination strings are normalized with the same rules used for CONNECT requests: hostnames are lowercased, omitted ports default to `443`, and IPv6 destinations use bracketed `host:port` form.

`capacity_bytes` and `refill_bytes_per_sec` define a per-permission token bucket. `capacity_bytes` is the maximum burst the agent can emit in a single window; `refill_bytes_per_sec` is the sustained throughput. The bucket is enforced at CONNECT time (refuse with `429` if empty) and continuously during the tunnel (the upstream-side write path is metered, and a write that would drain the bucket terminates the tunnel cleanly). Because the limits are part of the signed canonical bytes, a compromised gateway with read-write access to `permission_registry` still cannot raise them without the principal's signing key.

### In-flight propagation of expiry and revocation

The rate-limit bucket also acts as the kill switch for two other reasons an in-flight tunnel might need to end early:

- **Permission expiry.** The bucket carries the signed `not_after` and treats itself as dead when `now() >= not_after`. The next write through the metered upstream returns `io::Error`, the tunnel closes, and the next CONNECT for the same permission is refused by the policy engine in the usual way.
- **Explicit revocation.** A background task in the gateway polls `permission_registry` every 30 seconds for rows whose `revoked_at` has been set. For each such row, it marks the corresponding in-process bucket as revoked. Active tunnels using that bucket then fail their next write through the same path. Propagation is bounded by the 30-second polling interval; throughout that window the bucket continues to enforce the signed rate limit at full strength, so a just-revoked agent's total transfer between revocation and the next poll is capped at one burst plus up to 30 seconds of sustained throughput at the signed rate.

These two paths use the same `MeteredStream` error code path as the rate-limit deny; there is no special-cased control flow per termination reason.

## Client requirements

Clients must:

1. **Connect over HTTP/2 with mTLS.** Present a structurally valid client certificate and prove possession of the certificate private key during the TLS handshake. The certificate must contain a custom X.509 extension at the OID configured in `policy.client_ext_oid`, with a DER-encoded UTF8String value. The full leaf SubjectPublicKeyInfo DER must match an active signed permission row.

2. **Use the HTTP CONNECT method.** The request authority must be `host:port` (port defaults to 443 if omitted). Example using `hyper`:

   ```rust
   let req = Request::builder()
       .method(Method::CONNECT)
       .uri("api.example.com:443")
       .body(Empty::<Bytes>::new())?;
   ```

3. **Handle TLS to the destination.** After receiving `200 OK`, the tunnel is an opaque TCP pipe. The client must perform its own TLS handshake with the destination through the tunnel.

### Response codes

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | Tunnel established -- begin sending data |
| `400` | Malformed request (missing/invalid authority) |
| `403` | Policy denied the connection |
| `405` | Non-CONNECT method used |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded (the signed `capacity_bytes` for the matching permission has been depleted); response includes a `Retry-After` header in seconds when the bucket has a non-zero refill rate |
| `502` | Could not reach the destination |

### Client certificate extension

The extension value is matched exactly (case-sensitive) against signed permission rows. The extension must be an X.509 extension at the configured OID containing a single DER-encoded ASN.1 UTF8String.

Example certificate generation with `rcgen`:

```rust
use rcgen::{CertificateParams, CustomExtension};

let oid: &[u64] = &[1, 3, 6, 1, 4, 1, 57264, 1, 1];
let value = der_encode_utf8_string("agent-alpha");
params.custom_extensions.push(
    CustomExtension::from_oid_content(oid, value),
);
```

## Tests

```
cargo test
```

Database-backed policy and e2e tests require `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to point at a Postgres database that the test process can migrate and write to. The tests cover policy evaluation, signed-permission verification, signer delegation scope enforcement, destination normalization, config validation, TLS PKI generation, and proxy request parsing.

## SQLx Query Metadata

Checked SQLx query macros compile against committed `.sqlx` metadata by default, so normal builds do not need database access. The metadata is derived from the migrations; it does not replace the migration SQL used to create or update the database schema.

Regenerate the metadata after changing migrations or SQL query text:

```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli --version 0.8.6 --locked --no-default-features --features postgres
SQLX_OFFLINE=false DATABASE_URL="$TEST_DATABASE_URL" cargo sqlx database setup
SQLX_OFFLINE=false DATABASE_URL="$TEST_DATABASE_URL" cargo sqlx prepare -- --all-targets --locked
```

## Demo repository: registry-cli must be updated to sign v2

This gateway expects every permission row to be signed in the v2 canonical-bytes format (with `capacity_bytes` and `refill_bytes_per_sec`). The sister demo repository `agent-gateway-demo` ships a `registry-cli/agent-permissions.sh` that currently signs v1. To use this gateway with that demo end-to-end, the script needs a small parallel update: two extra lines in the canonical-bytes here-doc and two corresponding `--set=` flags on the `psql` invocation that inserts the row, plus two new CLI parameters surfacing the values. The diff is small and mechanical; this gateway repository's PR does not modify the demo repo.
